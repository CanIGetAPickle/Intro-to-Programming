Intro to Programming exercises

These are the requisite exercises from the "Introduction to Programming with Ruby" course text from Tealeaf Academy.

The majority of the solutions are fairly straightforward. Some of them contain code that has been commented out
  for the sake of testing different code without constantly deleting and/or rearranging code (not to mention Ctrl+/
  is a convenient shortcut!). An example of this is "hash6.rb," where I provided the original solution above my own.
